# Data Analyst App  

## Overview  
The **Data Analyst App** is a powerful data processing tool developed using the **MATLAB 2024a GUI** on macOS. It is designed to perform a range of data analysis tasks such as filtering, temporal normalization, synchronization, and normalization with adjustable parameters. The app is versatile and applicable to any numerical dataset, making it suitable for a variety of applications.  

Originally created as part of a **data analysis final project**, the app was designed to streamline and simplify complex data analysis workflows.

## Features  
The app consists of **six functional tabs**:  
1. **Settings:** Configure adjustable parameters and analysis methods.  
2. **Comparisons:** Compare multiple datasets with customizable metrics.  
3. **Statistical Test Results:** Perform and display statistical analyses on the data.  
4. **Raw Data Visualization:** Visualize uploaded datasets in their original form.  
5. **Parameter Comparisons:** Analyze and compare parameters like standard deviation and peak values.  
6. **Results Tab:** Consolidate and interpret analysis results for easy reporting.

## Functionality  
- **Data Types:** While the app was developed with knee flexion angle data (from gait cycles) as an example, it is **generalized for any numerical dataset**.  
- **Analysis Options:**  
  - Filtering with multiple customizable approaches.  
  - Temporal normalization and synchronization of datasets.  
  - Parameter normalization and comparison (e.g., standard deviation, peaks).

## Purpose  
The app was developed for the **Data Analysis Final Project**, but its flexibility makes it a valuable tool for broader numerical data analysis tasks.  

---

## Getting Started  
1. Install **MATLAB 2024a** or later.  
2. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.  
3. Open the MATLAB `.mlapp` file in the **App Designer** environment.  
4. Load a numerical dataset into the app. The provided example uses knee flexion angle data during the gait cycle.  
5. Explore the features through the six tabs for an interactive analysis experience.
